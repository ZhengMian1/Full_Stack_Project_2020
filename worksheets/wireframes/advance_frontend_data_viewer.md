#### Good Points

1. Attributes shown at top and bottom can be useful for big table.
2. Showing total number of entries can be useful for us.
3. Search bars for navigation
4. Has editing, upload and deletefeatures

#### Bad Points

1. Data boxes a bit too big and this may not be ideal as we do not need big data boxes for storing the data.
2. Data with many column may be bad. 
3. The translated search bar may not be needed as we are only searching by festivalId, startTime and endTime.
